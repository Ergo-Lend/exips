Parties Involved
----------------
**Lender** -  A person who loans out money to someone who is requesting funds
**Borrower** - A person who is asking for funds in which they promise to pay back the capital and interest in a later period of time

Motivation
----------
Single Lender protocol allows a lender to take up the burden of funding an entire loan. This opens up the lender to a risk of 100% for the fate of the loan. The goal of this implementation is to reduce the amount of risk that a lender has to take on in a single loan.

Scenario
--------
Benny the Borrower instantiate a loan with a funding goal of $2000, requesting it to start a carrot farm.

### Funding Loan
Lenny has some funds laying around and is interested in helping Benny out by funding his loan. However, he does not know if Benny will surely repay him back and would like to only contribute $200 of the $2000 goal (10%).

On the Loan page, Lenny choose to fund $200. After signing the Tx, the loan page shows that $200 has been raised in Lenny's newly created Lenders pool to fund Benny's Loan (it is automatically created if no pools are present, we'll call this pool the *Benny Loan's Crowd Funding Pool* in the continued reading).

Lorra is another person who is interested in funding the loan. She is willing to take up the remainder funds that needs to be funded ($1800), and decided to fund *Benny Loan's Lenders Pool*. The Lender's pool meets the amount of the loan and is then spent alongside the Loan Box where the repayment will be pointed towards the crowd funding pool address.

### Repayment of Loan
Benny got the funds and started working on his farm. A month later, he started his first repayment. He repays his dues of $200 via the Single Lender Protocol.

The Single Lender Protocol then transfers the funds to the address that is specified in the repayment box. The address being *Benny Loan's Crowd Funding Pool*. At this point of time, the lender pool stated has $200.

The pool then redistributes the $180 to Lorra and $20 to Benny.

Design Specification 
-------------
### Questions to Ask
1. During repayment, what if the pool does not have enough Erg for repayments to be conducted (to create boxes and for transaction fees)?
2. What if someone funds the whole Loan after the pool is created?
3. Can people create Multiple Pools?
4. Should pools be in the same address? If yes, how are the Single Lender Protocol gonna repay to the right boxes?
5. What if a person funds it once, and then wants to fund it again? Does their value get merged? or do they have 2 separate values in the pool?

### Specification 
#### **Integrating with Single Lender Protocol**
The implementation of Lenders Pool should be a modular component within the Exle system where it interacts with the Single Lender Protocol.

#### **User Experience**
The implementation has to makes sense to user and provide them a 0 confusion experience. The experience of a Pool should feel as similar to crowd-funding as possible while at the same time addressing the issue that may come about as a pool.

Real-Life Tx
-------------
1. Lenny **choose** Loan to fund
2. Lenny **creates** a Crowd Funding pool
- **Q: Are Crowd Funding Pool a big pool with lots of funds?**

    A: Yes, however, it is specific to a loan. Each pool that is created to fund a loan is individually different from the other. 
3. Lenny **funds** the Crowd Funding pool with the amount he wants to fund
4. The Crowd Funding pool **records** the amount that Lenny funded
5. Lorra wants to fund the loan too and **picks** Lenny's Crowd Funding pool
- **Q: What if Lorra decides to create another Crowd Funding Pool, is that allowed?**

    A: Preferably, we would want to create only one pool. However we have to design the system before we can say whether we can limit it to one only. And if so, how we are going to do it.

6. Lorra **funds** the Crowd Funding pool with the amount she wants to fund
- **Q: Can the pool be overfunded?**

    A: A check should be implemented so that the pool can never be overfunded. Meaning the value of the pool should not exceed the loan request. This can be done by using the LoanBox as a data Input everytime the pool is being funded.

7. The Crowd Funding pool **records** the amount that Lorra funded
8. Steps 5-7 can be repeated till Crowd Funding pool is filled up with the loan amount
- **Q: How does the pool know whats the amount for the loan?**
    
    A: The pool can use the loan box as a data input.

9. Funds from the Crowd Funding pool **funds** the Loan and a repayment box is created from the LoanBox, and the Crowd Funding Pool **turns** into a *repayment state*.
- **Q: Can a Crowd Funding pool in a repayment state receives funds?**
    
    A: It can.

- **Q: What if the funds that is received by the Crowd Funding pool is not from the repayment box?**
    
    A: Preferably we don't want to allow that to happen. However, instead of preventing that from happening, we can allow that to happen and let lenders be rewarded in some ways. However the Crowd Funding box should never be voided until the Loan is fully repaid.

- **Q: Do we ever destroy the Crowd Funding Pool?**
    A: When repayment is fully paid (checked via repayment box of the loan), then the Crowd Funding pool for that particular loan can be destroyed.

10. Borrower starts repaying the loan by funding the repayment box. The funds from the *repayment box* is **distributed** to the *Crowd Funding Pool Address*.
- **Q: SLT purely sends the funds to the address, wouldnt that mean there's just a bunch of fund boxes at the address?**

    A: Yes, there will be a bunch of boxes with funds in it from repayment. However, there should be a master box there which contains all the registers with adequate info to process the boxes and return the funds to the lenders.

NOTE: As the Crowd Funding pool does not have extra Ergs to process the repayment to all Lenders. Lenders will have to send some Ergs to initiate the process of repayment to their own wallet.

11. Lenny wants to retrieve his repaid funds. He **funds** the Crowd Funding pool with the tx fee required. The Crowd Funding pool uses the Tx Fee provided to send Lenny's share of the repayment back to him.
- **Q: What if Lenny retrieves his repayment, but Lorra hasn't? Will that affect how much Lorra receives, since the pool is at a different balance of funds now?**

    A: There's 2 ways of dealing with this issue. It either receives the required tx fee to repay the share equally to everyone in 1 tx. Or it has to bookkeep how much has been repaid to each lender, and prevent any extra repayments to be made once a lender receives his full share.

12. Step 11 is repeated for Lorra and Lenny until repayment is finished being repaid.

13. Repayment has been completed (checked via Repayment box of the loan), and the CrowdFunding pool box is absorbed and destroyed.

Boxes
-----
In this implementation. There should only be 1 box, or rather 1 contract. The Crowd Funding Box/Pool. There may be many boxes that exists in the pool. However there should be one box that contains the master information of the pool. 

This master box contains all information of the pool, including lenders, how much they funded, the loan box id, and how much has been repaid. Other than that, it should have a token that allows it to be easily identifiable and retrievability for better user experience.

- **Q: Would different Crowd Funding pool for different loans exists on the same address? Or would it all exists in different address?**

    A: Pools for the same loan should all stay in the same address. However different loans would have pools with different address.

### Crowd Funding Master Box
| Box Component | Value | Register Type |
| ---  | ---  | ----- |
| R0 - Value    | 0.0001 Ergs | Long |
| R2 - Tokens   | [Identifier Tokens, Loan Tokens] | Coll[(id, value)] |
| R4            | LoanBox Id | Coll[Byte] |
| R5            | Lenders and their funded Share | AVL Tree |
| R6            | Lenders and amount repaid (activated after repayment starts) | AVL Tree |

#### Box Actions List
1. Creation
2. Pool Being Funded
3. Fund Loan
4. Receives Loan
5. Repayment to Lenders (Activated by Lenders)
6. Absorption/Destruction of box (when repayment completes)

#### Box Conditions (Persisted Data)
