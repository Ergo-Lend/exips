Parties Involved
----------------
**Lender** -  A person who loans out money to someone who is requesting funds
**Borrower** - A person who is asking for funds in which they promise to pay back the capital and interest in a later period of time

Motivation
----------
Single Lender protocol allows a lender to take up the burden of funding an entire loan. This opens up the lender to a risk of 100% if the loan was from a scammer. The goal of this implementation is to reduce the amount of risk that a lender has to take on in a single loan.

Scenario
--------
Benny the Borrower instantiate a loan with a funding goal of $2000, requesting it to start a carrot farm.

### Funding Loan
Lenny has some funds laying around and is interested in helping Benny out by funding his loan. However, he does not know if Benny will surely repay him back and would like to only contribute $200 of the $2000 goal (10%).

On the Loan page, Lenny choose to fund $200. After signing the Tx, the loan page shows that $200 has been raised in Lenny's newly created Lenders pool to fund Benny's Loan (it is automatically created if no pools are present, we'll call this pool the *Benny Loan's Lenders Pool* in the continued reading).

Lorra is another person who is interested in funding the loan. She is willing to take up the remainder funds that needs to be funded ($1800), and decided to fund *Benny Loan's Lenders Pool*. The Lender's pool meets the amount of the loan and is then spent alongside the Loan Box where the repayment will be pointed towards the Lenders pool address.

### Repayment of Loan
Benny got the funds and started working on his farm. A month later, he started his first repayment. He repays his dues of $200 via the Single Lender Protocol.

The Single Lender Protocol then transfers the funds to the address that is specified in the repayment box. The address being *Benny Loan's Lenders Pool*. At this point of time, the lender pool stated has $200.

The pool then redistributes the $180 to Lorra and $20 to Benny.

Design Specification 
-------------
### Questions to Ask
1. During repayment, what if the pool does not have enough Erg for repayments to be conducted (to create boxes and for transaction fees)?
2. What if someone funds the whole Loan after the pool is created?
3. Can people create Multiple Pools?
4. Should pools be in the same address? If yes, how are the Single Lender Protocol gonna repay to the right boxes?

### Specification 
#### **Integrating with Single Lender Protocol**
The implementation of Lenders Pool should be a modular component within the Exle system where it interacts with the Single Lender Protocol.

#### **User Experience**
The implementation has to makes sense to user and provide them a 0 confusion experience. The experience of a Pool should feel as similar to crowd-funding as possible while at the same time addressing the issue that may come about as a pool.
